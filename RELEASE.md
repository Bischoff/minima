# minima
minima is a simple Linux repository manager.

Currently, the only implemented functionality is the smart downloading of RPM and simple DEB repos from an HTTP source for mirroring. Downloaded repos can be saved either in a local filesystem directory or an Amazon S3 bucket.


## Release

A release action is setup. Pushing a new tag will create a new release.
